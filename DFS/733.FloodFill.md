To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel,
plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel,
plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels(also with the same color),
and so on.

Replace the color of all the aforementioned pixels with color.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def flood_fill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        r, c = len(image), len(image[0])
        directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
        start_color = image[sr][sc]
        
        def dfs(i, j):
            # reject those coordinates which
            # are invalid 
            # already colored with new color
            # do not have the original color as start_color
            if i<0 or j<0 or i>=r or j>=c or image[i][j]==color or image[i][j] != start_color:
                return

            image[i][j] = color
            for x,y in directions:
                xx, yy = x + i, y + j
                dfs(xx, yy)  

        dfs(sr, sc)
        return image
```
