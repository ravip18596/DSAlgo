### Points

1. Since the graph is a DAG, we are not worried that we might get stuck in a loop as we traverse it (no cycles/loops), thus the visited set that normally accompanies graph traversal algortihms is not needed.

2. Moreover, a visited set would actually ruin the algorithm for us and we need to get rid of it, because in this particular problem we need to generate all paths, and for that we might visit some nodes more than once. Those are the nodes that are common among multiple paths. See nodes colored in red below. So not only that we don't need a visited set, we actually must NOT use one.
