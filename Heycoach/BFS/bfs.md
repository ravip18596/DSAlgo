# BFS (Breadth First Search)

## Shortest Path in Binary Matrix

```text
Given a square binary matrix, find the length of the shortest path from the top-left cell to the destination cell 
given as (x, y) moving only in up, down, left, right directions.
consider matrix as 0 indexed. You must return -1 in case of no path.
```

```text
Input
3 4
1 0 0 0 
1 1 0 1 
0 1 1 1
2 3
Output
5
Explanation:
we have to go from A[0][0] to A[2][3]. Minimun steps will be 5.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, n, m, mat, x, y):
      pass
```
