Problem
--------
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]


Solution
--------

### python

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # using two pointer approach
        dummy = ListNode() # p1
        left = dummy
        left.next = head
        right = head # p2

        # first move right pointer by n positions
        while n > 0 and right:
            right = right.next
            n -= 1

        # move both left and right pointers
        while right:
            left = left.next
            right = right.next
        # the left node is left adjacent to the node we have to delete
        # delete node
        left.next = left.next.next

        return dummy.next
```
