Problem
--------
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
substring
of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.


Solution
--------
`Sliding Window`

- Time Complexity: O(n)

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if len(t) == 0: return ""
        countT, window = {}, {}
        for c in t:
            countT[c] = 1 + countT.get(c, 0)

        l = 0
        res, resLen = (-1, -1), 1e9
        have, want = 0, len(countT)

        for r in range(len(s)):
            window[s[r]] = 1 + window.get(s[r], 0)
            if s[r] in countT and countT[s[r]] == window[s[r]]:
                have += 1

            while have == want:
                # update res
                if (r-l+1) < resLen:
                    resLen = r-l+1
                    res = (l, r)
                window[s[l]] -= 1

                if s[l] in countT and window[s[l]] < countT[s[l]]:
                    have -= 1

                l += 1


        l, r = res
        return s[l: r+1] if resLen != 1e9 else ""
```
